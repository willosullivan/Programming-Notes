For example, if in addition to a new column, we also need to populate it with some values, we will need to add some \"insert\" or \"update\" script alongside the generated one so that once the column is added, the expected values are also populated accordingly."

    "- `branch_label` allows you to define what \"branch\" from the revision is this script for (similar to Git branches)\n",
    "    - One usage of this would be if you have different production and test databases\n",
    "        - If you have a single database, you may need to create \"test\" revisions that are not production ready yet, so you would need to make another branch to do that\n",
    "        - Similarly, another engineer would do the same and you won't impact each other since you're on different branches\n",
    "        - Whenever either one of them finishes their \"branched revisions\", they will just need to point it back to \"production\", without affected the tests that the other employee is doing\n",
    "- `depends_on` allows different branches to \"create dependencies\"\n",
    "    - For example, you need to use revisions that are from another team, but their revision is not in production yet, you can just create a dependency to their branch to allow you to test your own changes.\n",
    "    - Once both of your branches are ready, you can then merge back to \"production\"\n",
    "- `upgrade()` contains the actual code that alembic will execute when upgrading to this revision\n",
    "- `downgrade()` contains the actual code that alembic will execute when downgrading to the previous revision (usually the exact opposite of `upgrade()`)"
